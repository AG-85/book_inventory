Hi! I'm Ambikha, a QA Engineer with 10+ years of experience in software testing. While I have a strong foundation in manual testing, my primary focus is on test automation, DevOps practices, and AI-driven testing solutions.

I'm passionate about building scalable, efficient automation frameworks and integrating AI into QA to optimize testing processes.

# 📚 Book Inventory – Python QA Portfolio Project

This project simulates a simple book inventory management system using Python dictionaries. It's built to demonstrate clean coding practices, test coverage with `pytest`, and modern project structuring — all as part of my QA-to-Automation career path.

## 🚀 Features

- Add a book by title, author, and quantity
- Update quantity of an existing book
- Remove a book from the inventory
